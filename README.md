# Summer 2024 - Class Notebook

This notebook is used to store any code created for live sessions. Students should feel free to
fork this repo, adding their own notes and code as they follow along with the live sessions.

## Student Instructions for Contributing Notes

*Step 1:* [Fork the classNotebook](https://github.com/Su24-CS5004-Online-Lionelle/classNotebook/fork) repository

**What does forking do?** This will create a copy of the classNotebook repository on your own GitHub. Normally, we've been working with homework repos on our own person GitHubs so that we could easily clone them to make a local copy. When working with other developer's repositories, we might not necesasrily have permission to push directly to thier repository (so we need to make a copy for ourselves and then make changes to our own copy first). After we've made our own changes, by pushing them to our copy on GitHub, we can then open up a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to propose that they be added to the original owner's repoistory.

*Step 2:* Clone your copy of the classNotebook repository (create a local copy)

- Click the green code drop down in the upper right corner of the repo
- Click the "copy url to clipboard" for HTTPS (or use whichever method you normally use to clone)

*Step 3:* Open up the repository in your preferred editor (VS Code/IntelliJ) or in command line

*Step 4:* Open up the terminal in your code editor and type:

    git checkout -b yourNameNotes

This will create a new branch (separate from the main one) where you can make changes/add your own notes

*Step 5:* Make your own changes (add your notes, include code samples, etc.)

*Step 6:* Use `git add` in command line (or add in your IDE) to include the files that you added/modified

*Step 7:* Commit your changes (using `git commit -m "short commit message here"` or commit in your IDE)

*Step 8:* Push your changes to your GitHub and then open up a pull request with your changes
